 * Handles jump scrolling between cells in a ReactGrid.
 * If the next cell is not fully visible and it's not a sticky cell, it scrolls it into view.
 * It tries all four directions ("Right", "Left", "Bottom", "Top") one by one.
 * For each direction, it checks if there's a sticky cell adjacent to the center pane in that direction.
 * If there is, it checks if the next cell is fully visible and not colliding with the sticky cell.
 * If the next cell is not fully visible and it's not the sticky cell, it calculates the scroll value
 * and scrolls the scrollableParent in the direction to bring the next cell into view.
 *
 * @param store - The ReactGridStore instance.
 * @param previousCell - The previous cell (previously focused cell).
 * @param nextCell - The next cell (the one that we want to scroll to.)
